The last design is to not reveal the sampling outcome, so that adversarial attackers cannot dynamically adjust failure models accordingly.

The problem may be trivial in a purely uniform environment, which is unfortunately not the case in reality. Thanks to central limit theorem, we are able to design a distributed protocol that contains large number of uniformly distributed sampling, and recover certain uniformity properties of the system and eventually ensure durability.
