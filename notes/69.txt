Before thinking about how broker pick the most cost efficient inference service to fulfill the requirements, take a while on how users specify the requirements. Are they really specifying?

There are ranking solutions for the models, but users hardly say "give me response which is ranked >= 42.42" or something.

The demand itself is inherently subjective. The broker will then have to interpret it subjectively. To formally define the goal here is the novelty.

We could start with something more automated. Something more akin to what sky computing is for, and gradually move to the interactive scenarios.
