Users are already behaving as brokers by themselves. They generate image descriptions interactively, then feed the descriptions into text to image models. They are creating tiny ad hoc workflows.

The GPT is a gating expert model which includes a meta model as broker. There are other models driven external tools e.g. Wolfram Alpha or other models to solve the tasks.
