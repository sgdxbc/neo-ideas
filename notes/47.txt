The new researching is not purely on performance and scalability, but to make more secure systems while maintaining the level of performance and scalability. The old works, although not intended, were more secure systems than centralized ones (at least potentially). The superior security comes from the fact of being open systems, allowing everyone to impact system properties in its own way (either good or bad). The centralized systems, while can (claim to) deploy anything good for durability, are manipulated by the only player i.e. system owners. Even through it is possible for the systems to eliminate single point of failure on technical aspects, there's a single point of failure in the trust model, because all the fault tolerance mechanisms on technical aspects are deployed by that trusted party.

We believe that the hardware has been evolved even further and became powerful enough to overcome the cooperation overhead while maintain user experience. In these days we are able to develop powerful storage systems that are not controlled/defined by any single party. The belief of durability does not require users to trust specific participants, and user only need to make minimal overall assumptions to the participants e.g. they must belong to sufficient number of different failure domains.
