At this point we may additionally claim that the problem is actually trivial if not considering correlated failures. Suppose that among N storage nodes 1/3 of them are faulty. It's not necessary to store fragments of each object on N/3 + 1 nodes. We can simply store e.g. 10 fragments on different storage nodes, where any set of 5 fragments can recover the object. Since each storage node independently fails, we can calculate the interval T that the probability of 6 nodes consecutively fail within the T interval is negligible, and then design a storage protocol that can make at least one repair within T. It's easy to prove that such system ensures the durability of objects.

This is not the case when there are correlated failures. So we have the following designs.
